# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis


This is the code that accompanys my paper which covers the research area of machine learning, namely sentiment analysis. The paper investigates my hypothesis that sentiment in news headlines directly affects the movement of stock prices on the U.S stock market.
Additionally, this report aims to find the correlation between news headline sentiment and public opinion around specific stocks. The stocks that are measured are the top US technology securities.  
Approach included 
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Feature engineering
  - Evaluation of Three models - Logistic regression , SVM and Naive Bayes
    
My findings were that there is no overall correlation between tweet and headline sentiment. Finding also report and overall negative correlation between tweet sentiment and stock prices over the two year time frame of analysis.
